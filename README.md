# parkinson-classification-using-tremor
This study suggests using a random forest algorithm to classify tremors in Parkinson's disease 
patients. The algorithm is trained using patient movement data that has been preprocessed and 
labeled based on the type of tremor present (resting tremor, postural tremor, or kinetic tremor). 
The trained model is then tested on a separate set of unseen data to determine its accuracy in 
classifying the various types of tremors. The results show that the random forest algorithm 
accurately classifies tremors in Parkinson's disease patients.
